# CONVEX HULL EXPERIMENTS

## Overview

Full implementations of three major algorithms for finding the [convex hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull) of a set of points:
- Jarvix March
- Graham Scan
- Chan's Algorithm

The code also includes a simple experimental framework to compare the performance of the three algorithms, along with plenty of sample experiments.
